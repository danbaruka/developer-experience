title: Maintainer Retainer Program (MRP)
---

Here’s a quick overview of the **Maintainer Retainer Program (MRP)** and the two kinds of maintainers it involves. For the full picture (eligibility, funding, reviews), check the [official OSC MRP page](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/paid-open-source-model-posm/maintainer-retainer).

### What is the MRP?

The MRP provides **recurring funding** to experienced contributors who maintain **critical Cardano open-source repositories**, so those projects stay secure, regularly updated, and actively developed. [Intersect](https://www.intersectmbo.org/) runs the program with the Open Source Committee (OSC) and Technical Steering Committee (TSC).

### Core vs Community Maintainers

**Core Maintainers** are senior project stewards with **final technical authority** over a repo's direction. They own strategic decisions, governance and policy work, release sign-off, and security-sensitive changes; they mentor others and ensure long-term project health. Think of them as the people who lead and make the big calls.

**Community Maintainers** are **Trusted Committers** (in an eligible project) who join the program via application to expand capacity around a project. They focus on day-to-day maintenance, user-feedback loops, and community operations (code, docs, triage, talking to users) without holding ultimate decision rights or high-risk credentials. They must meet the [Contribution Ladder](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/policies/contribution-ladder-framework) threshold (≥ Trusted Committer) and pass the program's **30-day evaluation** before ongoing funding. Your contributions can be coding, documentation, governance, or ecosystem advocacy; it’s not only about code.
