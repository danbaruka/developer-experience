title: Maintainer Retainer Program
---

Here’s a quick overview of the **Maintainer Retainer Program (MRP)** and the two kinds of maintainers it involves. For the full picture (eligibility, funding, reviews), check the [official OSC MRP page](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/paid-open-source-model-posm/maintainer-retainer).

### What is the MRP?

[Intersect](https://www.intersectmbo.org/) runs the MRP with the Open Source Committee (OSC) and Technical Steering Committee (TSC). The idea: pay experienced maintainers so they can keep important Cardano repos in good shape: secure, up to date, and actively developed.

### Core vs Community Maintainers

**Core Maintainers** are the people who lead a project. They make the big calls on direction, releases, and security, and they mentor others. Think of them as the senior stewards.

**Community Maintainers** join through an application. They help with the day-to-day (code, docs, triage, talking to users) without having the final say. You need to be at least a [Trusted Committer](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/policies/contribution-ladder-framework) and pass a 30-day evaluation to get ongoing funding. Your contributions can be coding, documentation, governance, or ecosystem advocacy; it’s not only about code.

**Where to get the latest:** [Maintainer Retainer (OSC)](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/paid-open-source-model-posm/maintainer-retainer). When in doubt, link to that page instead of copying names or details into your repo; it’s the one that stays up to date.
