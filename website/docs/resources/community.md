# Community Resources

There are a variety of community resources in the Cardano ecosystem for anyone looking for help, wanting to connect with other builders, or just needing to know where to ask a question? Explore and let us know where we can improve.

## Where Should I Go?

| What You Need | Where to Go | Link |
|--------------|-------------|------|
| Quick question or real-time help | Discord or Telegram | See Discord section below |
| Detailed problem that needs troubleshooting | Stack Exchange (search first!) | [cardano.stackexchange.com](https://cardano.stackexchange.com) |
| Feedback on tools or docs | GitHub Discussions | [developer-experience](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/developer-experience/discussions) |
| Technical consultation for your project | OSO Project Support | [oso@intersectmbo.org](https://committees.docs.intersectmbo.org/intersect-open-source-committee/about/open-source-office-oso/project-support-services) |
| Meet other developers | Working Groups or meetups | See Events section |
| Stay in the loop | Cardano News | [cardano.org/news](https://cardano.org/news/) |


## Discord Servers

Discord is where most real-time conversations happen. Here's where to go depending on what you need:

| Server | What It's For | Key Channels |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Intersect** <br/>[join intersect](https://intersectmbo.org/membership) | Working groups, governance, developer experience | `#developer-experience` <br/>`#technical-working-groups` <br/>`#open-source-committee` |
| **IOG Technical** <br/>[iohk.io/community](https://iohk.io/en/community/) | Core infrastructure deep-dives | Node ops, consensus, networking |

## Forums

When you need more than a quick back-and-forth, forums are your friend.

**Cardano Forum** - [forum.cardano.org](https://forum.cardano.org)  
This is where longer technical discussions happen, along with CIPs (Cardano Improvement Proposals) and project showcases. The Developers section is particularly active.

**Stack Exchange** - [cardano.stackexchange.com](https://cardano.stackexchange.com)  
The best place for specific technical questions. Pro tip: search before you post—chances are someone's already answered your question. Tag appropriately (plutus, smart-contracts, cli, etc.).

**Reddit**  
- [r/CardanoDevelopers](https://reddit.com/r/CardanoDevelopers) - Developer-focused news, tutorials, and projects
- [r/Cardano](https://reddit.com/r/Cardano) - General ecosystem discussions
