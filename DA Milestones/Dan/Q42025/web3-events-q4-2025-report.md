I participated in the **Btrust Developer Day on 2 December** as part of the developer-focused kickoff.  
The day was dedicated to hands-on workshops, technical deep dives, and collaborative sessions aimed at empowering African and Global South developers to build open-source Bitcoin infrastructure.

While the conference was Bitcoin-centric, many themes are relevant for Cardano as well, including:

- Developer-first training formats and low-barrier onboarding  
- Focus on African financial inclusion and real-world use cases  
- Cross-community collaboration across regions and ecosystems

## Overall Impact

Together, these two events:

- Strengthened relationships with emerging developer communities in Africa  
- Highlighted opportunities for Cardano in education, financial inclusion, and local innovation  
- Provided concrete insights into how developer-focused formats (dev days, workshops, hubs) can accelerate ecosystem growth and open-source contributions
