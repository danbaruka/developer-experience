# Intersect Developer Experience Survey — 2025 Update

Thank you for participating in the Intersect Developer Experience Survey. Your feedback is crucial for helping us improve the tools, documentation, and support we provide to builders on Cardano. This survey focuses on your development journey, technical challenges, and how Intersect can better serve you.

## Are you a developer and building on Cardano?

The Developer Advocate team here at Intersect would like to gather unique perspectives and fresh insights to support the ever-expanding developer ecosystem in Cardano.

We've created this survey to gather your thoughts, opinions, and experiences in building on (or contributing to) Cardano.

It's been a year since Intersect's Open Source Office published the Paid Open-Source Model whitepaper for our community. As Developer Advocates, we want to ensure the next steps reflect your real needs and experiences. This brief survey will help shape how the Open Source Office evolves its programs and how the Open Source Committee directs funding to empower developers, maintainers, and contributors across Cardano.

Your input will enable Intersect and the broader Cardano community to:

- Better understand the pain points and challenges faced by early-career developers and non-native English speakers
- Create targeted initiatives and resources to support your growth and success
- Foster a more inclusive and supportive environment for all developers

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts, and we look forward to hearing your valuable insights!

**Estimated time to complete the survey:** 11 - 12 mins
