## 3. Current DevEx Status (High-Level Assessment)

### Status Summary

|------|--------|----------|
| Developer Onboarding | ⚠️ Needs Improvement | High |
| Documentation Quality | ⚠️ Mixed | Medium |
| Session Participation & Accessibility | ⚠️ Improving | Medium |
| Website & Infrastructure | ✅ Actively Improving | Low |

### Developer Onboarding

**Status:** ⚠️ **Needs Improvement**

**Assessment:**

Developer documentation remains fragmented and scattered across multiple repositories and platforms. New developers often lack a clear, structured roadmap indicating where to start and how to progress.

**Key Need:**

- A unified onboarding roadmap for new developers
- Clear entry points based on developer profiles and use cases

---

### Documentation Quality

**Status:** ⚠️ **Mixed**

**Assessment:**

- Some core repositories are well-documented and actively maintained
- Others are outdated or lack practical, step-by-step guidance

**Observed Issues:**

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Inconsistent structure across repositories | Reduces discoverability and usability |
| Limited cross-linking between related resources | Hinders navigation and learning flow |

---

### DevEx Session Participation & Accessibility

**Status:** ⚠️ **Improving**

**Challenges Identified:**

Some developers were unable to join recurring DevEx sessions due to:

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Late Access | Meeting links were not available in a timely manner |
| Navigation Issues | Unclear navigation to session resources |
| Scheduling Confusion | Confusion around scheduling and calendar access |

**Actions Taken:**

| Action | Description | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Floating Action Button | Added to DevEx documentation website to direct developers to live sessions, provide quick access to meeting links, and enable easy calendar integration | High |
| Calendar Integration | Embedded session links directly into developer calendars to reduce friction | High |

---

### DevEx Website & Infrastructure

**Status:** ✅ **Actively Improving**

**Progress Made:**

- Initially, DevEx content existed primarily as a repository
- With the support of the TEX team, the DevEx website was:
  - Fully deployed

  - Structured for continuous improvement

**Current State:**

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Maintenance | Actively maintained |
| Updates | Regularly updated |
| Purpose | Structured to serve as a central reference point for developers |

---

### Ongoing Improvements
