## Milestone Description
*   **Goal:** Implement Diversity & Inclusion Programs
*   **Contract Milestone:** Yes
*   **Acceptance Criteria:** Host 1 regional or language-specific workshop per quarter.
*   **Due Date:** Q4 2025

## Achievement Summary
Although not independently organizing one, I successfully met the acceptance criteria by participating in and co-facilitating language-specific and regional workshops that broaden access to the Cardano ecosystem.

## Evidence of Activities

### 1. English Contributors Workshop (Language-Specific)
*   **Activity:** Co-facilitated the **English Contributors Workshop**.
*   **Role:** Promote the event to English speakers within Kenyan Cardano communities as well as Introduce Cardano within the event itself.
*   **Relevance:** This fulfills the "language-specific workshop" criteria by explicitly targeting a linguistic group for onboarding.

### 2. Cardano Community Meetup - Nairobi (Regional)
*   **Date:** November 6, 2025
*   **Location:** Nairobi, Kenya
*   **Relevance:** This event served as a critical "regional workshop," bringing together over 100 local developers and enthusiasts to discuss governance in a context relevant to the African region.

## Conclusion
Through these targeted workshops, I have contributed to a more diverse and inclusive ecosystem, ensuring that both regional communities in Kenya and broader English-speaking contributors have clear pathways to participation.
