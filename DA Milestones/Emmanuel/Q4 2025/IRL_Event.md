#### Objective
The primary objective of this event was to introduce Cardano to the Nairobi developer and blockchain community, and to launch a recurring series of workshops aimed at onboarding and educating both new and existing developers within the Cardano ecosystem.



#### Event Summary
The Cardano Community Meetup was successfully held at Blockchain Centre NBO and marked the first session in an ongoing community engagement initiative. The event brought together developers, blockchain enthusiasts, and newcomers interested in decentralized technologies and governance.

A featured session was delivered by **Haron Mwangi (Developer Advocate)**, focusing on **Bitcoin and Cardano governance models**. The session highlighted Cardano’s community-driven governance structure, with particular emphasis on its on-chain treasury model that enables sustainable, community-funded development, in contrast to Bitcoin’s reliance on external donors.
