## Community Events Report: My Experience as Developer Advocate


### Overview
This quarter I focused on two key community experiences. The first was engaging directly with developers in the Cardano ecosystem, helping them learn, contribute, and prepare for the upcoming Cardano Africa Tech Summit (CATS) hackathon. The second was attending the Adamur Builder’s Mixer, where I wanted to observe how another team has successfully built an active developer community around Base and Sui, and learn practical tips that I can apply to growing the Cardano ecosystem locally.


## Event 1: Cardano Community Meetup & CATS Hackathon Mentorship

This was a big one for me. Advocates Harun Mwangi and I were formally invited to mentor hackathon applicants for CATS. The program runs **every Thursday evening until February**, so it’s not just a one-off event — it’s a commitment to guide developers over several weeks leading up to the summit.

**About CATS:** Organized by Blockchain Centre NBO, an initiative started by WADA and 2lovelaces, the goal is to grow a strong blockchain community in Nairobi and prepare builders for the CATS Hackathon happening in February.


### Cardano Community Meetup (Nov 6, 2025)
- **Attendance:** 100+ participants  
- **Speaker:** Harun Mwangi  
- **Topic:** Governance Interaction: Cardano vs Bitcoin

I loved seeing the energy in the room. The session delivered a deep dive into governance models, and we also took the chance to highlight the value of joining IntersectMBO. From this meetup, we were able to **identify and onboard dedicated mentees** who are now part of the ecosystem and actively participating in study sessions and working groups.


### Cardano Study Sessions
- **Schedule:** Every Thursday, 5 PM UTC  
- **My role:** Primary mentor guiding developers consistently  
- **Harun’s role:** Bi-weekly technical support and guidance  

**Recent session:** Dec 4, 2025  
We worked through the Andamio platform courses and helped students enrolled in the CBCA program. My focus was to **clear blockers, answer questions, and refine project ideas** for the hackathon. Seeing participants gain clarity and confidence during these sessions was very rewarding.

**Impact for me personally:** I could see how consistent mentorship and practical guidance really makes a difference for new developers. It also reinforced the importance of keeping the sessions interactive and hands-on.

## Event 2: Adamur Builder’s Mixer – “The Final Commit of the Year”

**Date:** Dec 13, 2025  
**Location:** Antler EA, ABC Place, Nairobi  

I attended this event not to lead, but to **learn from a different community**. Adamur has done a fantastic job building a developer ecosystem around Base and Sui, and I wanted to see what they are doing to **keep builders engaged, motivated, and actually shipping products** like https://www.expendi.app/.

**Highlights for me:**
- The community vibe was incredible — builders sharing lessons, celebrating wins, and reflecting on the year.  
- Observing their structured programs, mentorship approach, and cross-ecosystem participation gave me ideas for how to **strengthen Cardano community initiatives in Nairobi**.  
- Networking with builders helped me understand what keeps them committed to learning and shipping, which I can use to shape future workshops and study sessions.

## Overall Reflections
- Mentoring new Cardano developers has been extremely rewarding. Watching them grow, ask questions, and start contributing reinforces why community engagement is so important.  
- Attending the Adamur event reminded me that **community-building is about relationships, structure, and consistent support**, not just content delivery.  
- Combining these two experiences gave me practical ideas to improve how we onboard developers, run study sessions, and maintain momentum leading up to CATS and beyond.


## Next Steps
- Continue weekly CATS mentorship sessions until February.  
- Follow up with mentees to ensure they are ready for the hackathon.  
- Apply lessons from Adamur to design more engaging, hands-on, and community-focused Cardano events.  
- Identify builders from broader Web3 communities who could be interested in exploring Cardano tooling and contribution opportunities.
