### Onboarding Report: Developer Engagement & Integration


#### Overview
During this quarter, I actively engaged and onboarded developers who were new to the Cardano ecosystem through 1-on-1 conversations, community events, and guided participation in working groups. The onboarding approach focused on helping developers identify suitable contribution pathways, gain confidence in open-source participation, and integrate into existing Cardano and Intersect structures.


#### Developer Engagement Summary
- **3 developers** engaged through direct 1-on-1 onboarding conversations.
- **2 developers** are actively attending Intersect working group sessions.
- **1 developer** with prior smart contract experience is in ongoing discussions to join the Smart Contract Working Group.
- Additional developers were onboarded through attendance and follow-up from a Cardano community meetup event.

- Williard Owiti  
- Peter Maina  
- Noel Wesley  
- Ben  
- Cindy Joan  
- Daisy Sawe

- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d5MYePeFeQ4bdrxTc1XXqiQXixO_z0d9QorzzImRWkA/edit

**Outcome:**  
The event served as an effective entry point for onboarding multiple developers into Cardano discussions and follow-up sessions, validating community events as a scalable onboarding mechanism.


#### Outcomes & Impact
- **Lowered entry barriers** for new developers through personalized guidance.
- **Increased working group participation** from newly onboarded developers.
- **First-time open-source contribution** achieved by a new ecosystem developer.
- **Pipeline created** from community events → 1-on-1 support → working group involvement.
- Strengthened local developer pipeline connected to Intersect and Cardano governance structures.
